\begin{abstract}
Finding information on the World Wide Web has become of central importance to everyday affairs. Users often have certain needs such as relevancy, speed and accuracy of results. Since the web consists of so many inconsistencies in terms of relevant word to a specific page, this has not been an effortless task to maximise user needs. Over the past few decades, ranking algorithms in information retrieval systems have largely shaped not only how we surf the web, but also how we navigate private information such as emails and files in cloud storage. The goal is to cover the user's needs with the most relevant documents, given one or multiple search terms in such a way that the results are fair, justified, and capture the intent of the user. This report explores some of the most widely adopted algorithms and compare their performance on an original test. Based on an index of the UCL Computer Science department domain (cs.ucl.ac.uk), we report results on Boolean retrieval, Term frequency -- Inverse Document Frequency, BM25 and query likelihood ranking algorithms, each with the added option of including PageRank authority scores. After evaluating our results through precision, recall and the F1 measure we concluded that BM25 performs best out of the four ranking algorithms, with query likelihood following closely behind. It was also observed that for our restricted domain with relatively few internal hyper links, PageRank does not add relevance value, as it overemphasises pages with incoming hyper links.
