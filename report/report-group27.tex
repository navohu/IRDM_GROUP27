\begin{abstract}
Finding information on the World Wide Web has become of central importance to everyday affairs. Over the past few decades, ranking algorithms in information retrieval systems have largely shaped not only how we surf the web, but also how we navigate private information such as emails and files in cloud storage. Search engines determine the information we come across, and most crucially, what we do not see. As such, it is essential that their rankings are fair, justified, and capture the intent of the user. In this work, we give an overview of some of the most widely adopted algorithms and compare their performance on an original test set. Based on an index of the UCL Computer Science deparment domain, we report results on Boolean retrieval, Term frequency -- Inverse Document Frequency, BM25 and query likelihood ranking algorithms, each with the added option of including PageRank authority scores. Based on our relevance evaluation, BM25 performs best out of these algorithms, with query likelihood following closely behind. We also find that for our restricted domain with relatively few internal hyperlinks, PageRank does not add relevance value, as it overemphasises pages with incoming hyperlinks.
